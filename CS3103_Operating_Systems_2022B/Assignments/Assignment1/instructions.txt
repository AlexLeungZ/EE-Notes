-----Setup Instructions
Cmake is needed here to make sure we use c++17 and including the library "filesystem" which is used in my program
1. Make sure cmake and readline library is installed on the system
- sudo apt install cmake
- sudo apt install libreadline8

2. Make sure the c++ compiler is the latest version (if it isn't it won't work)
- sudo apt install gcc --upgrade

3. To ensure best environment please make a new folder and put in the "mini_shell.cpp" and "CMakeLists.txt" in that new empty folder

4. List of commands to build once everything is ready
- cmake .           //This is to set up cmake
- make              //Build the binary file
- ./bin/shell       //run the compiled binary file

Notes:
- If you want to compile "test.cpp" as well, put it in the folder and modify the "CMakeLists.txt"
