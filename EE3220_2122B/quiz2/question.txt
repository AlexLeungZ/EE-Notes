Translate the following C program into Assembly program for the ARM processor. Explain what is the meaning of each assembly statement. What will happen if the first two lines of code are moved inside the main loop()?
// int a = 1;
// int b = 0;
 int main(void){
    int a = 1;
    int b = 0;
    b = a + 1;   
    return 0;
}

Describe the development from ARMv7 to ARMv9-M, what new elements are added to the processor. Give 2 examples of Data Transfer Instructions in the ARM family and define what is Mnemonic.

A processor with 8-bit words for multiple-precision addition of two 32-bit unsigned numbers:
1F C6 24 7B + 00 57 ED 4B
Describe how the data are placed in the memory, and then write a program / Pseudocode to execute the addition, using add and add with carry instructions.

What is the difference between branch instructions and jump instructions? Using ARM processor as an example, write a code segment to show the difference.

In this question, you are going to use Mbed to design a simple LED flashing. Write up the C program and describe the procedure to complete the whole design flow. Hint: you may need to use "mbed.h".

Describe what is stacking and unstacking when Interrupt occurs. What is the relationship with thread (the main program) and the exceptional handler?

Describe the key similarities and differences amongst Mbed, Keil Studio Cloud and ARM Development Studio. If you are one of the student members in the CityU Underwater Robotics Team, which one should we use and why?

In the following given Assembly program, describe what this program does, and translate it to the approximate C program. Can we get an optimized version of this assembly code running on a processor?
