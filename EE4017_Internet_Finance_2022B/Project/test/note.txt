Some of the post functions return a value and they don't allow "GET" so added them to there's no errors

whatever andy did in his zoom I tested and some of the works with the server.py
- need to change node indicator from the port to something else
- doing transactions right now in my modification just takes in a string of an address without checking if its a valid address
- if you wanna get address, i added /getaddress which is basically just the wallet initialized in the beginning of the server 
- the balances seem to be hardcoded to 0.0 (i hope im wrong)
