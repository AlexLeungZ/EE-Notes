1. Open the terminal to the current folder directory.
2. Run "cmake .".
3. Run "make".
4. then the compiled binary will be in the newly created 'bin' folder.

The main program "55724681.cpp" depends on the pthread library, generate_frame_vector.cpp,
and cache.h in order to run.

Just incase anything goes wrong, I've included the compiled binaries as well.
