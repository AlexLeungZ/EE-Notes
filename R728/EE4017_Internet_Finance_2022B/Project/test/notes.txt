curl -d "node=127.0.0.1&com_port=5000" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/register_node

For server.py

Some of the post functions return a value and they don't allow "GET" so added them to there's no errors

whatever andy did in his zoom I tested and some of the works with the server.py
- need to change node indicator from the port to something else
- doing transactions right now in just takes in a string of an address without checking if its a valid address
- if you wanna get address, i added /get_address which is basically just the wallet pub key initialized in the beginning of the server 
- the balances seem to be hardcoded to 0.0 in the class (i hope im wrong)
