Bond vs Stock

- stocks are financial instruments

- stocks give partial ownership in a corporation, but not bonds
- liquidity of stocks and bonds is lower than cash or cheques

- bonds provide steadier income than stocks

Tokenization
- It is the process of exchanging sensitive data for non-sensitive data such as "tokens" that would be used
in a database for authentication and authorization of services or actions.

Sensitive data examples can be credit card number, pin, account name, etc.

- So instead of directly providing sensitive data to perform an action or use a service, we would use
"tokens" instead that represents the sensitive data in the service's database. This will prevent attacks
that involve stealing information.

Man in the middle attack
- It is when a attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe 
they are directly communicating with each other.

One example would be to setup fake wi-fi connections where they'll be able to track the online activity of the users
and gain access to their personal login info, payment-related information and many more. This can be considered as a flaw in the
mobile standards/protocols.

Replay attacks
- It is the action of recording communication and then replaying the recording to circumvent security.

One example would be where the attacker would intercept NFC transactions and then replay it to authorize
even more transactions.

Repudiation
- It is the process of modifying information (most of the time it is history, logs or receipts) in an unauthorized manner.

One example would be if a mobile user sent transfer request of $150 but instead the attacker modifies this
request when sent to be $15000 instead.

Impersonation
- It is the act of posing as a trusted contact to manipulate victims into doing certain actions for the attacker's benefit.

One example would be where the attacker would pose as a bank employee and messaging the victim, and then tricking
the victim into giving up sensitive information such as account name, number, pin, and everything else that the
attacker would then use for their own benefit.

Unauthorized access
- It is the act of breaking into the victim's account without their knowledge to perform malicious actions.

One example would be when a user would install malware into their mobile phones, and the malware
would hijack their mobile payment apps into authorizing payments in which the victim does not approve of
or have the knowledge of.
